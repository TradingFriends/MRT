
1	Robot Baseline
We have now a very basic baseline that was the result of some discussions. it is developed in mq4 and the code is included.

It considers:
•	Long entry points.
•	Short entry points
•	Exits with profit
•	Exits with Loss

1.1	Long entry points

The criteria now is set to:
•	We limit the entry at some hours in the day to exclude minor variations during the pre-market.
•	We say it is a Long entry point when:
o	the MACD (13 ,5, 8) crosses the signal line for the current and previous ticks ascending and,
o	the Current Standard Deviation is greater than the Moving Average of the Standard Deviation and
o	the current Standard Deviation is greater than the previous Standard Deviation.

  if(OrdersTotal()==0 && Hour()>=16 && Hour()<=23){
    if(fastMACDSignal_0 < fastMACDMain_0 && fastMACDSignal_1 > fastMACDMain_1 && // Cross MACD
       stdDev_0 > maStdDev_0 && stdDev_0>stdDev_1 // Standard Deviation crosses MA
      )
    {
      ticket = OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,0.01,Ask,10*Point,NULL,NULL);
      OrderModify(ticket,NULL,Bid - 2*atr,NULL,NULL);

1.2	Short entry points
The criteria now is set to:
•	We limit the entry at some hours in the day to exclude minor variations during the pre-market.
•	We say it is a Long entry point when:
o	the MACD (13 ,5, 8) crosses the signal line for the current and previous ticks descending and,
o	the Current Standard Deviation is greater than the Moving Average of the Standard Deviation and
o	the current Standard Deviation is greater than the previous Standard Deviation.
  if(OrdersTotal()==0 && Hour()>=16 && Hour()<=23){
    if(fastMACDSignal_0 > fastMACDMain_0 && fastMACDSignal_1 < fastMACDMain_1 && // Cross MACD
       stdDev_0 > maStdDev_0 && stdDev_0>stdDev_1 // Standard Deviation crosses MA
      )
    {
      ticket = OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELL,0.01,Bid,10*Point,NULL,NULL);
      OrderModify(ticket,NULL,Ask + 2*atr,NULL,NULL);

1.3	Exits with profit
The criteria now is set to for the Long:
•	When the Moving Average of the current tick is smaller than the previous moving Average, meaning that moving averages changed direction.
        if(OrderType()==OP_BUY && (maFast_0 < maFast_1) && OrderProfit()>0) {
          OrderClose(OrderTicket(),0.01,Bid,10*Point);

The criteria now is set to for the Short:
•	When the Moving Average of the current tick is smaller than the previous moving Average, meaning that moving averages changed direction.
        if(OrderType()==OP_SELL && (maFast_0 > maFast_1) && OrderProfit()>0) {
          OrderClose(OrderTicket(),0.01,Ask,10*Point);

1.4	Exits with Loss
The criteria now is set to:
•	When the 2*ATR is reached for Longs and Shorts. ATR is calculated for the last 5 periods.


2	Next Steps
2.1	Fine Tune existing baseline
2.1.1	Test Longs
With the current baseline, analyse all the entry and exit points and document:
•	Good entry points.
•	Good exit points with profit
•	Bad entry points
•	Bad exit points with profit
•	Good exit points with minimum of losses
•	Bad exit points with losses

2.1.2	Test Shorts
The same now for Shorts.

2.2	Implement Machine learning

To implement machine learning we need a set of indicators to “train” the machine learning algorithm. The proposed indicators are below:

From Investor.com
•	RSI(14)
•	STOCH(9,6)
•	STOCHRSI(14)
•	MACD(12,26)
•	ADX(14)
•	Williams %R
•	CCI(14)
•	ATR(14)
•	Highs/Lows(14)
•	Ultimate Oscillator
•	ROC
•	Bull/Bear Power(13)

From http://stockcharts.com
•	Bollinger Bands
•	Chandelier Exit
•	Moving Averages - Simple and Exponential
•	Moving Average Envelopes
•	Pivot Points
•	Price Channels
•	Volume by Price
•	Average Directional Index (ADX)
•	Average True Range (ATR)
•	DecisionPoint Price Momentum Oscillator
•	Force Index
•	Know Sure Thing (KST)
•	Mass Index
•	MACD
•	MACD-Histogram
•	Money Flow Index (MFI)
•	Rate of Change (ROC)

There are also some: Introduction to Market Indicators, should we use them?
